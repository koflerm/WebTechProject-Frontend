# Webtechnologies Course 2020/21 Project - Frontend

This project is the frontend for a university project. It has been written in Angular and depends on the backend written by my colleague. This repository only includes the frontend.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.

## Live Demo

This project can be found using the following link: https://webtec-frontend.herokuapp.com/ (The website might not immediately react as this is a free dyno hosted by heroku.com which means it has to spin up first if it has been idle).

## Installation

To run this application, execute 'npm install'. After that you can run a development server using 'ng serve' or 'npm run ng serve'.

## Source Code
